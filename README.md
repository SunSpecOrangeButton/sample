# Sample Data

The following contains fully anonymized sample orange button data.   This can be used for test cases.  Each sub-folder maps to a data or document element in the taxonomy.  Under the sub-folder is the Orange Button Data.  In some cases samples of legacy data are also present (to test the converter software).  They are always placed in a folder named legacy format.

Anonymizing test data attempts to create files such that the values are believable but not actuals.  Celestial objects (Milky Way, Jupiter, Saturn, etc...) are used as fictional company names.  The file formats themselves are equivalent to real data.

The first set of sample data (Monthly Operating Reports) was provided by sPower and Wells Fargo.
