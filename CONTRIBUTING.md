# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Orange Button Sample Data.  Sample Data allows for building of unit test cases and also allows for full integration testing.  Finally it allows organizations to reach a better understanding of the Orange Button data format and discuss nuances.

# Ground Rules
Responsibilities

* Ensure that sample data is either entirely public or entirely anonymized.  If the data was originally supplied by another party make sure that they have a chance to peruse the data before contribution.
* Follow the file system hierarchy discussed in the README.md file (i.e. organize data by Orange Button data or document name and place legacy data in a sub-folder marked "legacy-format".
* Respect all community members at all times.

# Getting started
You must sign the Orange Button Individual or Corporate Contributors agreement before enhancing or changing the documentation.

There is no formal process for working on the sample data itself.  Sample Data can be added without pull requests or pull requests may be used if preferred.

Please send an email to support@sunspec.org so we are aware of your intent to contribute.  Optionally it is ok ask for a review of changes in advance although this is not strictly required.
